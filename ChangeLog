2011-08-07 Version 8.0

	This is a major release even if it is fully compatible with old data
	files, the caching scheme has been reviewed to better handle millions
	of emails a day with very low memory footprint. The issue was reported
	by Martin Culak with around 1,5 million of messages per days, great
	thanks to him, it help a lot for this release.

	- Remove day_cache program, the daily caching is now integrated into the
	  sa_cache script with the option -a or --actual-day-only. With huge
	  data you still need to run sa_cache each five minutes within crontab.
	- The caching files are now build per hour to avoid "Out of memory" on
	  very busy servers. So now you have cache files generated per hour, per
	  day, per month and year.
	- CGI script sa_report have been reviewed to handle those new cache file
	  and to always display the reports in the second.
	- A lot of work have been made to add more support to PostFix logs and
	  postscreen milter.
	- Fix missing link to detailed informations when there was just one
	  data file in the directory.
	- Limit numbers of top sender/recipient in pie graph to maximum 10. 
	- Add pid file support to sa_cache to prevent parallel execution. After
	  a system crash you may need to remove those pid files if you want
	  sendmailanalyzer and sa_cache to be run again.
	- Documentation reviewed.

UPGRADE: if you don't want to reinstall all and restart with empty data, you can
overwrite all Perl and CGI scripts. Backward compatibility of data files are
fully preserved but you may experience an error message on hours views on old
cached data. The error message is:

	"No cache file yet for this hour, please wait for next run of 'sa_cache --actual-day-only'."

Remember to remove the day_cache perl script ans replace your call to day_cache
in to your cron job by the new command forms:

	sa_cache --actual-day-only

If you want to be able to see the hours view without error messages or no record
found you can keep the previous version of the sa_report.cgi script to still
view those report.

2011-07-31 Version 7.2

	- Add support of ruleset check_relay logged without sendmail id. Thanks
	  to Jeff Kaminski for the report.
	- Add 'FaKe' prefix to automatic generated id, so that you don't waste
	  your time to search for a sendmail id into the log corresponding to
	  the sendmailanalyzer unique id.
	- Add a note in INSTALL file about sendmail LogLevel configuration
	  directive. The default value 9 don't need to be change to have
	  SendmailAnalyzer report, by increasing this value all debug messages
	  will be detected as error or rejection, so don't change this value.
	  Thanks to Jeff Kaminski for the comment.
	- Add message status percentage pie graph on Global Statistics Status
	  screen. Only status upper or equal than 1% are shown.
	- Add sender relay percentage pie graph on Top Statistics Senders
	  screen. Only sender relays upper or equal than 1% are shown.
	- Add recipient relay percentage pie graph on Top Statistics Recipients
	  screen. Only recipient relays upper or equal than 1% are shown.

UPGRADE: overwriting all Perl scripts will do the work if you don't want to
reinstall all. Backward compatibility of data files are fully preserved.

2011-07-08 Version 7.1

	- Fix delivery direction bug when destination relay was localhost.
	- Fix an error on domain report when the email address doen't have
	  one but just the username. Thanks to John Duthie for the report.
	- Add a new configuation directive DEFAULT_DOMAIN to add to an email
	  address if there's just the username (see fix above). By default
	  SendmailAnalyzer will add the '@localhost' domain but you may want
	  to change this domain, so use this directive.

UPGRADE: You can reinstall all or just override all Perl scripts, the backward
compatibility with old data files is fully preserved.

2011-06-09 Version 7.0

	- Add first support to Postfix mail log statistical reports. Thanks to
	  Mario Hobel the sample log file and for people who asked the feature.

UPGRADE: You can reinstall all or just override all Perl scripts, the backward
compatibility with old data files is fully preserved.

2010-05-19 Version 6.4

	- Add support to dnsbl-milter. Thanks to bversteeg for feature request.
	- Fix a bug in link to spam details search view.
	- Change link to SquidAnalyzer web site.

UPGRADE: just override the perl script sendmailanalyzer and sa_report.cgi CGI
perl script taking care of the configuration file path into those scripts
(search: sendmailanalyzer.conf). Also add dnsblmilter to the list of SPAM_TOOL
configuration directive if you want this report.

2010-05-06 Version 6.3

	- Rewrite some parts of the sendmailanalyzer command usage, with more
	  details.

file path into those scripts (search: sendmailanalyzer.conf). 
	

2010-01-21 Version 6.2

	- Add MERGING_HOST configuration directive to allow aggregation of
	  multiple mailhost that syslogs to a remote server throught rsyslog
	  to have only one SendmailAnalyzer report. Thanks to Slamp for the
	  feature request.
	- Add new configuration directive CLAMD_NAME to set syslog name of
	  Clamd. Default is 'clamd'. When using Mailscanner with clamd if you
	  want virus report you must configure clamd to log with syslog and
	  use LOG_MAIL. This fix virus report for Mailscanner+clamd.
	- Add SHOW_DIRECTION configuration directive to enable/disable
	  direction statistics. On some mailhost this could show wrong
	  information if the direction of messages could't be determined.
	  So you can remove this view by setting it to 0.
	- Fix "No record for this period" on Top SMTP Auth statistics if no
	  data where found.
	- Update documentation.

UPGRADE: Only sendmailanalyzer and sa_report.cgi has changed, just edit these
files to set the path to the configuration file (search: sendmailanalyzer.conf)
and override old ones. Edit sendmailanalyzer.conf and new directives like in
Makefile.PL. Or of course the traditional install will do the job. This release
is fully backward compatible.



2010-01-20 Version 6.1

	- Fix RPM spec file that was overriding http sendmailanalyzer.conf
	  by the main sendmailanalyzer.conf.

	  messages interface.
	- Fix Messaging Status report of 'User unknown'. Removed ESMTP code.
	- Add fallback to /etc/sendmailanalyzer.conf if default config file
	  doesn't exist to simplifying upgrade with packaging or custom install.

UPGRADE: simply override all perl scripts (sendmailanalyer,sa_cache,day_cache,
cgi-bin/sa_report.cgi). In these scripts you may have to modify the global
variable $CONFIG_FILE as it point to default path to sendmailanalyzer.conf
and fall back to /etc/sendmailanalyzer.conf if the first is not found. So if
your config file is not in these paths, you must change it.


2010-01-05 Version 6.0

	- New SendmailAnalyzer site => http://sareport.darold.net/
	- Add install script and packaging support.
	- Remove all .pl extensions and rename sa_report.pl into sa_report.cgi

	(plain, login, etc.). This stat is not available in per domain view and
	can be disable in config file (see SMTP_AUTH).
	- Add SMTP Auth top view to display top auth mechanism, top connection
	relay and top authid. This stat is not available in per domain view
	- Add storage to pid file to keep track of the running daemon and
	allow easier start/stop script. This also fix a bug where SA do not
	stop on kill signal because is waiting for read on tail pipe. The pid
	now keep track of the 2 pids and then both are killed.
	- Remove top DNS sender and relay from stats, not really usefull and
	most of the time it returns false records.
	- Add Original recipient in DSN detail view.
	- Fix Top Sender Domain and Top Sender Address detail views when domain
	or address is empty (<>).
	- Add SPAM_VIEW and VIRUS_VIEW configuration directives to enable or
	disable the respective menus. By default they are enable.
	- Add SPAM_TOOLS configuration directive to choose antispam detail menu
	link to display. Default is all.
	- Autostart on main window when there's only one host and no per domain
	report.

UPGRADE: just replace old scripts by new ones as well as lang files. Edit your
cron to remove .pl extensions and replace -h syslogname with -s syslogname to
sa_cache and day_cache call or remove this option. Replace all lang/ files.
You may also rewrite your configuration file even if backward compatibility
is preserved to have all new configuration directives in it.

2009-11-23 Version 5.5

	- Fix many bugs and improve performances in detail views especially
	on per domain user access and top rejection statististics.

	takes the real ip address of the relay.
	- Fix access denied when click the bat logo on DOMAIN_USER views.

	- Change order of distribution flow to be the same in table and in
	graphs and fix lang file en_US. Thanks to Colin Stearman for the report.
	- Fix miss handling of greylisting milter reject messages. Thanks to
	Colin Stearman for the report.
	- Remove recipient relay from reject detailed view as it is always
	empty.
	- Remove link to details on top domain rejection when domain is <>
	as it always produce empty result.

	- Detail links are now shown every time provided that the .dat files
	already exists (instead of only in the current month). 
	- Fix "Different senders/recipients" break when there's no sender nor
	recipient. Note: Different senders/recipients are build uppon email
	really Sent. If no messages are Sent, they are null, even if you have
	many rejected message with sender.
	- day_cache.pl fix a case where DSN graph was empty.
	- Remove sender address as last try to find email direction. Too must
	error with spam. Now direction is only search based on domain or Ip
	address of the relay.
	- Remove last total line on Messaging Status. This was confusing as some
	messages appears on different status like deferred message that appears
	in Deferred and finally Sent.

    UPGRADE: Just overwrite all perl scripts and cgi, backward compatibility
	is preserved. Overwrite language file en_US. Configuration file is
	unchanged.

	This release is a complete rewrite of the CGI interface and a major
	rewrite of all Perl script (SendmailAnalyzer.pl, sa_cache.pl and
	day_cache.pl). It also save more memory when reports are displayed.
	This version is fully backward compatible with v4.x, so you can simply
	overwrite old perl scripts and cgi.

	Here are all addons/changes in this release.
	
	WARNING: The user view of personal mailbox stats has been removed for
	now. It used too much resources. If you use it please let me know I
	will try to work on it again.

	- SendmailAnalyzer is now GPL v3
	- You can dynamically change the language with a CGI parameter: lang.
	  Default language is read in the configuration file, but setting for
	  example &lang=sp_SP in the CGI URL the interface will instantly go to
	  Spanish language.
	- Better parsing of System messages (STARTTLS).
	- Improve detection and classification of message logged.
	- DSN : Delivery Status Notification are now traced and shown.
	- Fix report of spam from spamd.
	- Fix bug in set_direction() resulting in false delivery distribution.
	- Replace barorng.gif by salogo.png and URL_BAR by URL_LOGO in config.
	  option. Take care of this if you're upgrading.

	  configuration directive. This is use to try to defined the delivery
	  direction on some sendmail configuration.
	- Add REPLACE_HOST configuration directive to allow anonymization
	  of hostnames in sender/recipient relay information.

	If you need parsing support for other milter let me know i will do it.

	- Fix virus detection with new versions of MailScanner.
	- Add ANONYMIZE configuration directive to not show sender
	  or recipient addresses.

	  one time by cron. See INSTALL file to see how to run it.
	- Add year/month command line argument to sa_cache.pl to build
	  cache for a single month. This can be usefull to free performance
	  more quickly on a huge mail server if you run sa_cache on multiple
	  month.

	  statistics in sa_report.pl and sa_cache.pl. It is now in a function
	  called set_destination().
	- Fix SendmailAnalyzer.pl to not register false syserr related to
	  Milter log. If syserr message doesn't contain a space character
	  (single word only) it's for sure a parser mistake, so it is skipped.

2008-03-26 Version 3.1
	- Add support for compressed log file (need zcat)
	- Add support for MimeDefang Spam and Virus reports
	- Change translation 'Internet incoming' to 'Incoming' to avoid
	  confusion on a non mail gateway system.

	  storage space and improve status report reliability.
	- Improve MTA system message detection.
	- Add parsing of milter spamassassin report (spamd output)
	- Modify sa_report.pl to better support custom authentication
	  for user/mailbox view. There's now a check_mailbox_auth()
